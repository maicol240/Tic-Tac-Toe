# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows two players to enter their names and play against each other. After the game ends, players can start a new game by resetting the board.

## Features

- **Player Name Input**: At the start of the game, players can enter their names (Player 1 and Player 2).
- **Interactive Game Board**: The game board displays after names are entered, allowing players to take turns marking cells.
- **Start New Game Button**: After the game ends, players can reset the board and start a new game.

## How to Play

1. When the game loads, you will be prompted to enter Player 1 and Player 2 names via a form.
2. Once the form is submitted, the Tic-Tac-Toe board will appear.
3. Players take turns clicking the cells on the board to place their marks (X or O).
4. The game will detect if one player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
5. To start a new game, click the "Start New Game" button, which clears the board and allows players to play again.
